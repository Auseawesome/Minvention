# Sectors
sector.minvention-groundZero.name = Ground Zero
sector.minvention-groundZero.description = A sector harbouring a dormant core, the ideal starting point to reclaim this system.\nGather as much Iron and Copper as you can then march onwards.

# Items

## Metals

item.minvention-item-iron.name = Iron
item.minvention-item-iron.description = A hard malleable metal, ideal for the construction of structures
item.minvention-item-iron.details = Apparently before this metal was mined, they were using copper for structures!? Ludicrous.

## Natural Resources

item.minvention-item-snow.name = Snow
item.minvention-item-snow.description = A ball of solid water that can be easily melted.
item.minvention-item-snow.details = Very fluffy, if only we had time to build snowmen.
item.minvention-item-ice.name = Ice
item.minvention-item-ice.description = Solidified water, harder to mine but much denser than snow.
item.minvention-iten-ice.details = Very slippy, make sure it doesn't slide off the belt at the corners!

# Gasses

liquid.minvention-gas-steam.name = Steam
liquid.minvention-gas-steam.description = Vapourised water, very useful for powering machinery.
liquid.minvention-gas-steam.details = Legend says this was once used to power the armaments made by the mighty Eschatologue.

# Blocks

## Distribution

block.router.name = Mechanical Router
block.router.description = Allows routing of items down multiple different conveyors.
block.router.details = A black box, no-one knows how the internals of this router works.

### Conveyors

block.conveyor.name = Mechanical Conveyor
block.conveyor.description = A sturdy belt that can transport resource from A to B.
block.conveyor.details = Better than nothing, this conveyor belt is powered by the backup generator of the core.

## Production

### Drills

block.minvention-mechanical-drill.name = Mechanical Drill
block.minvention-mechanical-drill.description = A basic drill to harvest materials from the surface
block.minvention-mechanical-drill.details = Draws power from the backup generator of the core, only for emergency use.

### Steam Generation

block.minvention-steam-kettle.name = Steam Kettle
block.minvention-steam-kettle.description = Boils water to produce steam.
block.minvention-steam-kettle.details = Small and primitive, originally designed by Eschatologue to make instant noodles.

block.minvention-industrial-boiler.name = Industrial Boiler
block.minvention-industrial-boiler.description = Generates steam by boiling water with flammable materials.
block.minvention-industrial-boiler.details = A reinforced inner boiler designed by Eschatologue means it can produce steam signicantly quicker.

block.minvention-pressure-boiler.name = Pressure Boiler
block.minvention-pressure-boiler.description = Generates steam efficiently by boiling water under pressure with flammable materials.
block.minvention-pressure-boiler.details = A new design by Eschatologue uses negative pressure to extract the steam and allowing the water to boil quicker.

block.minvention-geothermal-boiler.name = Geothermal Boiler
block.minvention-geothermal-boiler.description = Generates steam when placed on hot tiles.
block.minvention-geothermal-boiler.details = Eschatologue came up with this design to allow for more renewable power, why burn resources when you can utilise geothermal energy?

# Sector Tutorials

tutorial.supply-turret = [accent]Supply Turret

## Ground Zero

tutorial.mine-iron = Move near the [accent]iron ore[] on the ground and click to begin mining.\nIron ore is used for nearly all structures.
tutorial.mine-copper = You will also need to mine some [accent]copper ore[] to build mechanisms.
tutorial.research = Open the tech tree.\nResearch the [accent]Mechanical Drill[], then select it from the production menu in the bottom right.\nClick on an iron patch to place it.
tutorial.conveyors = Research and place [accent]conveyors[] to move the mined resources\nfrom drills to the core.\n\nClick and drag to place multiple conveyors.\n[accent]Scroll[] to rotate.
tutorial.drills = Expand the mining operation.\nPlace more Mechanical Drills.\nMine 100 [accent]copper[] and more [accent]iron[].
tutorial.move-up-zero = Move up to the front line to continue your development.
tutorial.duos = Research and place 2 [accent]Duo[] turrets to defend the core.\nDuo turrets require [accent]ammo[] from conveyors.
tutorial.duos-copper = Supply the [accent]Duo[] turrets with [accent]copper[] using conveyors.\nResearching the [accent]router[] might help with this task.
tutorial.iron-walls = [accent]Walls[] can prevent oncoming damage from reaching buildings.\nPlace [accent]iron walls[] around the turrets or spawn zone.
tutorial.drop-zone-info = This is the enemy drop zone.
tutorial.drop-zone-warning = Anything built in or flying/walking inside the radius is destroyed upon wave start.
tutorial.wave-begin-warning = A wave of enemies is incoming, prepare to defend the sector.
tutorial.scatters = Normal turrets do not have the range to effectively take down flying units.\nUse [accent]Scatter[] turrets to rip through air units using heavy [accent]lead[] bullets.
tutorial.scatter-lead = Supply the Scatter turret with [accent]lead[], using conveyors.
tutorial.enemy-incoming = Enemy incoming, prepare to defend.
tutorial.finish = Build more turrets, mine more resources,\nand defend against all the waves to [accent]capture the sector[].
