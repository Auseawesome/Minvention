# Items

## Metals

item.minvention-item-iron.name = Iron
item.minvention-item-iron.description = A hard malleable metal, ideal for the construction of structures
item.minvention-item-iron.details = Apparently before this metal was mined, they were using copper for structures!? Ludicrous.

## Natural Resources

item.minvention-item-snow.name = Snow
item.minvention-item-snow.description = A fluffy ball of solid water that can be easily melted.
item.minvention-item-ice.name = Ice
item.minvention-item-ice.description = Solidified water, harder to mine but much denser than snow.

# Gasses

liquid.minvention-gas-steam.name = Steam
liquid.minvention-gas-steam.description = Vapourised water, very useful for powering machinery.
liquid.minvention-gas-steam.details = Legend says this was once used to power the armaments made by the mighty Eschatologue.

# Blocks

## Distribution

block.router.name = Mechanical Router
block.router.description = Allows routing of items down multiple different conveyors.
block.router.details = A black box, no-one knows how the internals of this router works.

### Conveyors

block.conveyor.name = Mechanical Conveyor
block.conveyor.description = A sturdy belt that can transport resource from A to B.
block.conveyor.details = Better than nothing, this conveyor belt is powered by the backup generator of the core.

## Production

### Drills

block.minvention-mechanical-drill.name = Mechanical Drill
block.minvention-mechanical-drill.description = A basic drill to harvest materials from the surface
block.minvention-mechanical-drill.details = Draws power from the backup generator of the core, only for emergency use.

### Steam Generation

block.minvention-steam-kettle.name = Steam Kettle
block.minvention-steam-kettle.description = Boils water to produce steam.
block.minvention-steam-kettle.details = Small and primitive, originally designed by Eschatologue to make instant noodles.

block.minvention-industrial-boiler.name = Industrial Boiler
block.minvention-industrial-boiler.description = Generates steam by boiling water with flammable materials.
block.minvention-industrial-boiler.details = A reinforced inner boiler designed by Eschatologue means it can produce steam signicantly quicker.

block.minvention-pressure-boiler.name = Pressure Boiler
block.minvention-pressure-boiler.description = Generates steam efficiently by boiling water under pressure with flammable materials.
block.minvention-pressure-boiler.details = A new design by Eschatologue uses negative pressure to extract the steam and allowing the water to boil quicker.

block.minvention-geothermal-boiler.name = Geothermal Boiler
block.minvention-geothermal-boiler.description = Generates steam when placed on hot tiles.
block.minvention-geothermal-boiler.details = Eschatologue came up with this design to allow for more renewable power, why burn resources when you can utilise geothermal energy?
